/**
 * This class is the main runnable class that keeps the activity queue updated in real-time.
 * It continuously checks the state of the queue, processes completed or outdated activities, 
 * and retrieves new activities to fill available slots. The class ensures that the queue remains 
 * synchronized with external data sources.
 * 
 * @param stateChecker - Responsible for examining the current state of the queue, handling concluded 
 * or outdated activities, and removing them from the queue as necessary.
 * @param inserter - Responsible for adding new activities into available (null) slots in the queue.
 * @param running - A flag that ensures the thread runs continuously until it is explicitly stopped. 
 * Used to gracefully terminate the loop when needed.
